# deep-translator-app
A cross platform all in one translator app

Motivation
----------
There is no app where many translators are integrated. 
Sure you can use google translate app, the pons app or the 
linguee app. However, what if you want to use an app, where
all these translators are integrated and you can switch between
them to get different translations?

This motivated me to create the deep_translator library, which you
can find here: https://github.com/nidhaloff/deep_translator
and this motivated me further to use the kivy framework to make
a mobile app based on the deep_translator tool.

Usage
------

- clone the repo
- run pip install -r requirements.txt
- run the main file to use the app locally
- you can use Buildozer to build the app and install it on your phone
